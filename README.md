# 🧠 Deep Learning Labs

This repository contains my solutions for all the laboratory exercises of the "Deep Learning" course at the Higher School of Computer Science (08 May 1945), Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, for 1st-year Master's students specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

## 📘 Overview

The labs cover practical applications of Deep Learning, focusing on both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation using PyTorch.
They include the study of neural network fundamentals, optimization, model evaluation, and modern architectures for image classification.

Main topics include:
